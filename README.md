Taxi Automation Scheduling System using Adaptive Real Time Shortest Path Algorithm involving women safety feature.
This project presents an algorithm to calculate and allot cab using real time variables and to reduce ETA(effective time of arrival) significantly.This algorithm uses real time variables such as distance, number of turns, road condition, cab condition, etc.The program also allocate the driver according to the userâ€™s preference of gender to provide women safety and a comfortable ride.
